        <h1>Alessandro Plantera<br>
            In Eterno</h1>
        <p class="abstract">
            This project was undertaken with the goal of assembling and preserving an archive of the artistic creations
            of my
            grandfather throughout his lifetime. He was a highly creative individual who wrote poetry, made drawings and
            created
            pictures using a typewriter. The significance of this project extends beyond personal sentiment, as it
            serves to
            safeguard and make accessible a cultural and historical legacy for future generations.
            </br>
            </br>
            Assembling the archive was a challenging process. It involved collecting his works from various sources such
            as
            photographs, old notebooks and analog files. I then had to organize and classify the material in a logical
            and
            user-friendly manner. This required me to learn coding and various techniques for digitizing and preserving
            his work.
            </br>
            </br>
            Despite the difficulties, I am proud of the final result. This archive now offers not just myself, but also
            anyone
            interested, the opportunity to explore and appreciate my grandfather's poetry, drawings, and other pieces.
            It provides a
            deeper insight into his character and artistry.
            </br>
            </br>
            I am deeply grateful for the assistance provided by chatgpt during this project, without which the goal of
            creating this
            archive would not have been possible.
            </br>
            </br>
            In conclusion, this project has been a labor of love and a way to connect with my grandfather in a new way.
            It serves as
            a lasting tribute to his talent and creativity, and I hope it will inspire others to pursue their own
            passions and
            dreams.

            The timeline above is the a dynamic and interactive way to display and organize information. It allows the
            user to easily understand how many "events" happened in a specific year and when my grandfather has been
            more active in producing stuff.

        <h1 class="title">Filters</h1>
        <img src="ReadmeImgs/Filters.svg">
        <p>
            The Filters above are the primary interactive element for navigating through a collection of works. It
            allows the user to filter and view specific subsets of the collection by clicking on different rectangles,
            each representing a different subject.
            Each rectangle has an associated subject, and when a rectangle is clicked, it calls a function that filters
            the elements of the collection based on that subject. The function then updates the visibility of the
            elements on the screen by adding or removing a class that controls the CSS styles. The user interacting with
            this filters, can navigate trough different subsets of the collection and exploring the works in a dynamic
            and engaging way.
        </p>
        <h1 class="title">Slider</h1>
        <video controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted" loop="">
            <source src="ReadmeImgs/HomeInteractiveSlider.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            The slider, made using the swiper library, is a user-friendly and interactive way to navigate through a
            collection of elements, such as images or text. The library allows developers to easily create a slider with
            a variety of customizable options, such as navigation arrows, pagination, and the ability to loop through
            the elements.
        </p>
        <h1 class="title">Slider and songs</h1>
        <video controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay" muted="muted" loop="">
            <source src="ReadmeImgs/HomeInteractiveSongs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            The slider is dynamic, responding to the click on a certain element by modifying the structure of the
            carousel. In this example, when a CD is clicked, the slider transforms into a player that allows the user to
            listen to the songs on that CD through a list. Also the background of the element is used to mark the
            elapsed time of the song

        <p>
            During my research phase i tried to figure out by my self how to create the timeline at the top left to be
            able to filter the elements in the dom. The first library i found was D3js, and it was way too complicated
            and overpower for my
            necessity.

        <p>
            So before thinking to the timeline, I had to figure out which strategy was best for creating a "database" of
            files that by accessing it could allow me to view each image, and for each image its back.

        </video>
        <p>
            After realizing that the d3js library was too complex to use I thought: why not do it with p5js? and then I
            started investigating to understand the feasibility, and actually it was much easier.

        <p>
            This is to show you the lenght of the chat i had with chatgpt from the beginning to the end for the creation
            of the timeline. It was quite difficult because in addition to acting as a filter, it also had to be
            faithful to the amount of data present in each year.
